Most of you will need help at some point and we want to make sure you can identify when that is without getting too frustrated and feel comfortable seeking help.

- **Sakai Forums:** The best way to get any questions on course content, technology, logistics, policies is to post your question on [Sakai's Forums](https://sakai.duke.edu). You are encouraged to answer each others' questions here as well. When you post a question on Sakai, you can choose to do so anonymously in some forums (not ones for identifying study partners!) to your classmates. Note that the course staff can always see your name, and this is for a good reason! We want to be able to identify students who might be struggling so that we can extend help. Similarly, we want to know who you are if you're providing great answers to others' questions! 

- **Student hours:** Course organisers will hold student office hours on Tuesdays (Prof Herring, 1-2pm, Jackie 2-3pm, Eli 5-6pm), Wednesdays (Prof Herring, 11:30am-12:30pm), and Thursdays (Phuc 4-5pm, Jackie 5-6pm). Please feel free to call in with any questions, or just to say hi! I am also available to meet by appointment, please use the link below to request one.
- **Email:** Please refrain from emailing any course content questions (those should go on Sakai Forums), and only use email for questions about personal matters that may not be appropriate for the public course forum (e.g. illness, major concerns).
- For more general support and advice, please make use of the following resources:
  - [HealthyDuke](https://healthy.duke.edu/mental/): Duke Reach, DuWell, CAPS, the Women's Center, peer counseling, and other great support
  - [Duke Academic Resource Center](https://arc.duke.edu/tutoring/overview): generic study skills support and potentially tutoring
  - [Private Tutoring from Stats Students](https://stat.duke.edu/undergraduate/current-students/course-help): Negotiate rates and times on your own
  - [Student Disability Access Office](https://access.duke.edu/students)

Make good use of this support system, it is there for you! And if you're not sure where to go for help, just ask any member of the course team.
