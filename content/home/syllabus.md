## Course components

### Weekly structure

- **Monday:** Code-along lab sessions
- **Tuesday and Wednesday:** Professor office hours
- **Wednesday and Friday:** Class
- **Thursday:** TA office hours


### Student hours

Prof. Herring will each hold office hours on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, and TA office hours will be on Thursdays. These will not be recorded, and zoom options will be available. It's a great time to get real time answers to your questions or just say hi!

### Code along sessions/labs

These will be held on Mondays, and they will not be recorded unless requested in advance. We expect that you show up to the workshop session you've been assigned to weekly. During these sessions you will work in teams on computing lab exercises and you will finish the exercises after the workshop and turn in your lab reports by Wednesday 4pm UK. Labs will be submitted as GitHub repositories and teams with the lowest score for each student will be dropped. 

A frequently asked question: "What happens if I can't make it to class or a lab one week because I'm sick or have another obligation at that time?" Answer below:

- First, if you have another obligation every week at the time of your lab, you should change into another lab. If you can't make any of the lab times, you should drop this class.
- Chances are you asked this question because you're only missing one or two workshops throughout the semester:
  - If you're missing a lab day due to short-term illness or some other reason, you should communicate this with your team and discuss accommodations. If you have made 0 commits towards a lab assignment, you will receive a 0 for that assignment, so you need to participate both for being a team player and also for your own individual score.
  - If you're unable to contribute to a lab assignment because of an illness taking you away from school work for an extended period of time, you should let your team know that you won't be able to contribute to that lab and either make this your dropped lab score or talk with your academic dean and Prof. Herring about options.
  
Overall these policies are put in place to ensure communication between team members, respect for each others' time, and also to give you a safety net in the case of illness or other reasons that keep you away from attending class once or twice.

### Homework assignments

Beyond the in class activities, you will be assigned regular homework assignments throughout the semester. These assignments will be completed individually and submitted to Gradescope. Homework with the lowest score for each student will be dropped. 

### Final project

You will be responsible for the completion of an open ended final project for this course, the goal of which is to tackle an "interesting" problem using the tools and techniques covered in this class. Additional details on the project will be provided as the course progresses. Each team's work will also be shared with and evaluated by at least one other team at an earlier stage in order to provide feedback. You must complete the final project and be in class (or on video) to present it. 

### Teams 

For all of the team based assignments in this class you will be randomly assigned to teams of 2-3 students - these teams will change after each assignment. You will work in these teams during class and on the homework assignment. For team based assignments, all team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of each assignment and you will be asked to evaluate your team members after each assignment is due. Failure adequately to contribute to an assignment will result in a penalty to your mark relative to the team's overall mark.

Students are expected to make use of the provided GitHub repository as their central collaborative platform. Commits to this repository will be used as a metric (one of several) of each team member's relative contribution for each homework.

## Grading

### Scheme

Your overall course grade will be comprised of the following components, and their weights:

- Homework: 15%
- Labs: 15%
- Project: 15%
- Exams (10% exam 1; 20% exam 2; 25% final exam)

A letter grade will be assigned as follows.

 | | | | |
----|----|----|----|----
93 | &le; | A  | &le; | 100
90 | &le; | A- | &lt; | 93 
87 | &le; | B+ | &lt; | 90
83 | &le; | B  | &lt; | 87
80 | &le; | B- | &lt; | 83 
77 | &le; | C+ | &lt; | 80
73 | &le; | C  | &lt; | 77 
70 | &le; | C- | &lt; | 73 
67 | &le; | D+ | &lt; | 70
63 | &le; | D  | &lt; | 67 
60 | &le; | D- | &lt; | 63 
0  | &le; | F  | &lt; | 60 


I never "curve down." These posted cut points are guaranteed minimums. As well, this course is not graded to a pre-specified distribution; if every student earns a 95 in the course, then every student will receive an A. I reserve the right to "curve up" using more generous cut points depending on overall difficulty of assessments.

Regrade requests must be made within two days of when a report is returned. These will be honored if points were tallied incorrectly, or if you feel part of your report is correct, but it was marked wrong (these things do happen!). No regrade will be made to alter the number of points deducted for an issue. When a regrade request is evaluated, if new errors are identified, additional points may be deducted from the grade.

## Policies

### Zoom expectations

- When in a large session you should,
  - have your microphone muted by default
  - use the raise your hand feature or type in the chat for questions and comments

- In the small team sessions you should,
  - have your camera turned on as much as possible
  - engage with your team mates via voice and text chat
  - take turns sharing your screen when necessary

### Collaboration policy

Only work that is clearly assigned as team work should be completed collaboratively. Individual assignments must be completed individually, you may not directly share or discuss answers / code with anyone other than the instructors and tutors. You are welcome to discuss the problems in general and ask for advice.

### Sharing / reusing code

I am well aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web to solve any number of problems. Unless I explicitly tell you not to use something the course's policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration). Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism. On individual assignments you may not directly share code with another student in this class, and on team assignments you may not directly share code with another team in this class. You are welcome to discuss the problems together and ask for advice, but you may not send or make use of code from another team.

### Academic integrity


Academic honesty is of paramount importance in this class, and all work must be done in accordance with the Duke Community Standard, reproduced as follows:

To uphold the [Duke Community Standard](https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct/about-us/duke-community-standard):
- I will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;
- I will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors; and
- I will act if the Standard is compromised.

By enrolling in this course, you have agreed to abide by and uphold the provisions of the [Duke Community Standard](https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct/about-us/duke-community-standard) as well as the policies specific to this course. Cheating or plagiarism on assignments, lying about an illness or absence and other forms of academic dishonesty are a breach of trust with classmates and faculty, violate this Standard, and will not be tolerated; any violations will automatically result in a grade of 0 on the assignment, be reported to the [Office of Student Conduct](https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct) for further action, and potentially a failing (F) course grade depending on the magnitude of the offense.

Occasionally, data sets we are privileged to use in class may be confidential and cannot be distributed more broadly or without express permission from the data-granting sponsor. Any unauthorized dissemination *or further use* of these data sets beyond this class is a violation of the Duke Community Standard. 

**Reusing code**: You are welcome to use online resources (e.g. StackOverflow). If you use code from an outside source, either directly or as inspiration, you *must explicitly cite* where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism and a violation of the Duke Community Standard. 

On individual assignments, you may not directly share code or write up with other students. On team assignments, you may not directly share code or write up with another team. Unauthorized sharing of the code or write up will be considered a violation for all students involved.

### Late work, extensions, and special circumstances

All work is due on the stated due date. Due dates are there to help guide your pace through the course and they also allow us (the course staff) to return marks and feedback to you in a timely manner. However, sometimes life gets in the way and you might not be able to turn in your work on time. Note, first of all, that we drop the lowest score of lab and homework assignments. So if you miss one assignment, this can be your dropped score. 

- **Late work policy:** Some assignments cannot be turned in late and some assignments can be turned in past the deadline with a late penalty:
  - Labs: No late work accepted
  - Homework assignments: Late work accepted up to 3 days past the deadline (i.e. Monday after the deadline, 4pm), with 10% penalty for each day. Grading of late assignments may be delayed.
  - Project proposal: Late work accepted up to 4 days past the deadline, with 5% penalty for each day
  - Project re-proposal: No late work accepted (this is an optional assignment)
  - Project: No late work accepted 
  - Exams: students with known conflicts on exam days should contact the instructor as soon as possible. Make-up exams will not be given. If the final exam grade is higher than the grade on either exam 1 or exam 2, then it will automatically be substituted to the student's benefit. 
    - Example: If a student misses the second exam, the final exam grade will substitute for the exam 2 grade.
    - Example: If a student misses the first exam, the final exam grade will substitute for the exam 1 grade.
    - Example: If a student misses both exam 1 and exam 2, the final exam grade will substitute for exam 2 (worth more points), and the exam 1 grade will be zero.
    - Example: If a student misses the final exam, the course grade will be X unless the student in failing (in which case the course grade is F). If no acceptable explanation is presented to the academic dean's office within 48 hours of missing the exam, the course grade is F. If the exam absence is excused, the dean, Professor, and student make arrangements for a make-up examination as soon as possible.
    - Example: If a student completes all three exams, and the final exam grade is higher than the grade for either exam 1 or exam 2, then the final exam grade will substitute for the prior exam grade in a manner that maximizes the student's score (because the exams have unequal weight in the final grade calculation, it may be preferable to use the final exam to substitute for the exam 2 grade due to its heavier weight, even if its score is slightly higher than the score on exam 1). If the final exam grade is lower than the grades on exam 1 or exam 2, no substitutions are made.
    



### Diversity & inclusion

It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.

Furthermore, I would like to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture.) To help accomplish this:

- If you have a name that differs from those that appear in your official Duke records, please let me know!
- Please let me know your preferred pronouns.
- If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don't hesitate to come and talk with me. I want to be a resource for you. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your academic dean is an excellent resource.
- I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it.

### Learning during a pandemic

I want to make sure that you learn everything you were hoping to learn from this class. If this requires flexibility, please don't hesitate to ask.

- Out of respect for others sharing your physical space, the class expectation will be that if you are sick, you will stay home and participate remotely. Accommodations 

- You *never* owe me personal information about your health (mental or physical), but you're always welcome to talk to me. If I can’t help, I likely know someone who can.

- I want you to learn lots of things from this class, but I primarily want you to stay healthy, balanced, and grounded during this crisis.
