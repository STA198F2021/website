My name is Amy Herring, and my pronouns are she/her/hers. I am Sara & Charles Ayres Distinguished Professor in the Department of Statistical Science and also hold appointments in the Duke Global Health Institute and in the Department of Biostatistics & Bioinformatics. I enjoy working on a variety of research projects on campus and beyond, and I'm excited to learn about your own interests! My work is focused on statistics and its applications in health, including analysis of longitudinal or otherwise correlated data, missing data and measurement error, Bayesian methods, and general biostatistics.  I earned my doctorate in biostatistics at Harvard, and before that I completed an undergraduate double major in English and mathematics. In addition to my work and family activities (data entry at swim meets, ha!), I enjoy reading, cats, [Wingspan](https://store.stonemaiergames.com/products/wingspan), and working outdoors (i.e., working on laptop on my porch overlooking the garden with a cup of black tea!).
