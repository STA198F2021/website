My name is Phuc Nguyen, and I use she/her pronouns. I'm a third-year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Statistical Science working with Professor Amy Herring and Professor David Dunson. My research interest broadly includes Bayesian statistics, analysis of multivariate data, its applications in health research, and R package development. Before Duke, I got my B.S. in Applied Math and Computer Science from Macalester College and worked as a data scientist at a startup in Minneapolis for a brief period. In my free time, I enjoy cycling, gardening, and being in nature.
