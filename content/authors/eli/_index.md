My name is Eli Feder, and my pronouns are he/him/his. I am a senior completing a B.S. in Statistical Science with a concentration in Data Science, a B.S. in Computer Science, and a minor in Economics. On campus, I am a member of two pre-professional organizations, [Catalyst](https://dukecatalyst.com) and [TAMID](https://www.tamidatduke.org), and a Pre-Orientation Program, [Project Waves](https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/new-students/preorientation-programs/project-waves). Outside of the classroom, I like to exercise, watch sports, explore nature, and play [Settlers of Catan](https://www.catan.com). Looking forward to the semester!
