My name is Alexandra Lawrence, and my pronouns are she/her/hers. I am a junior completing a B.S. in Computer Science and B.S. in Statistical Science with a concentration in Data Science. Outside of class, I am a member of Devils en Pointe and Business Oriented Women, and I enjoy baking and paddle boarding in my free time.
