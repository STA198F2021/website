Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel is Senior Lecturer in the School of Mathematics. Mine’s work focuses on innovation in statistics and data science pedagogy, with an emphasis on computing, reproducible research, student-centered learning, and open-source education as well as pedagogical approaches for enhancing retention of women and under-represented minorities in STEM. Mine works on integrating computation into the undergraduate statistics curriculum, using reproducible research methodologies and analysis of real and complex datasets. She also organizes [ASA DataFest](https://ww2.amstat.org/education/datafest/), an annual two-day competition in which teams of undergraduate students work to reveal insights into a rich and complex data set. Mine works on the [OpenIntro](openintro.org) project, whose mission is to make educational products that are free, transparent, and lower barriers to education. As part of this project she co-authored three open-source introductory statistics textbooks. She is also the creator and maintainer of [datasciencebox.org](https://datasciencebox.org/) and she teaches the popular Statistics with R MOOC on Coursera.
