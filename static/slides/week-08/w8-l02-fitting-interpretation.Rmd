## Mercury and Assets

Are mercury concentrations in hair related to household socioeconomic position, as measured by assets?

```{r packages}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(readr)
mercury <- readr::read_csv("mercury_reg.csv")
mercury <-
  mercury %>%
  # scale() subtracts the mean and divides by the SD to make the units "standard deviations" like a z-score
  mutate(assets_sc=scale(SESassets)) %>%
  #another variable we may use later
  mutate(form_min_sc=scale(FM_buffer)) %>%
  #so I don't have to remember coding
  mutate(sex,sex_cat=ifelse(sex==1,"Male","Female")) %>%
  mutate(native,native_cat=ifelse(native==1,"Native","Non-native")) 
```

---
## Goal: Predict mercury from assets

$$\widehat{y}_{i} = \widehat{\beta}_0 + \widehat{\beta}_1 \times x_{i}$$
Here $y_i$ represents log hair mercury for subject $i$, and $x_i$ represents standardized household income.
```{r hg_asset_plot, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = mercury, aes(x = assets_sc, y = lhairHg)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "#8E2C90") + 
  labs(
    title = "Hair mercury as a function of assets",
    subtitle = "Peruvian Amazon",
    x = "Household assets (standardized)",
    y = "Hair Mercury (log ppm)"
  )

## Step 1: Specify model

```{r}
linear_reg()
```

---

## Step 2: Set model fitting *engine*

```{r}
linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") # lm: linear model
```

---

## Step 3: Fit model & estimate parameters

... using **formula syntax**

```{r fit-model}
linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(lhairHg ~ assets_sc, data = mercury)
```

---

## A closer look at model output

```{r ref.label="fit-model", echo=FALSE}
```

.large[
$$\widehat{y}_{i} = 0.2795 - 0.3577 \times x_{i}$$

## A tidy look at model output

```{r}

## Slope and intercept

.large[
$$\widehat{y}_{i} = 0.2795 - 0.3577 \times x_{i}$$
]

--

- **Slope:** For each standard deviation increase in assets, the log hair mercury level is expected to be lower, on average, by 0.3577 log ppm.



- perhaps not a very useful statement given the scale


- **Intercept:** Individuals with household assets at the mean level (`assets_sc`=0) are expected to have hair mercury concentrations of 0.2795 log ppm, on average

  - Remember `assets_sc` was standardized, so `assets_sc`=0 does not mean "no assets" but instead means "average assets" as it corresponds to an assets z-score of 0

# Models with log transformation

---

## Working with logs

- Subtraction and logs: $log(a) âˆ’ log(b) = log(a / b)$

--
- Natural logarithm: $e^{log(x)} = x$

--
- We can use these identities to "undo" the log transformation

---

## Interpreting the slope

The slope coefficient for the log transformed model is -0.3577, meaning the log mercury difference between people whose household incomes are one SD apart is predicted to be -0.3577 log ppm.

--

.question[
Using this information, and properties of logs that we just reviewed, fill in the blanks in the following alternate interpretation of the slope:

>For each additional SD the household assets are greater, the hair mercury concentration is expected to be `___` , on average, by a factor of `___`.
]

---

>For each additional increase in scaled assets, hair mercury content is expected to be `___` , on average, by a factor of `___`.


$$ log(\text{hair Hg for assets x+1}) - log(\text{hair Hg for assets x}) = -0.3577 $$

--

$$ log\left(\frac{\text{hair Hg for assets x+1}}{\text{hair Hg for assets x}}\right) = -0.3577 $$

--

$$ e^{log\left(\frac{\text{Hg for assets x+1}}{\text{Hg for assets x}}\right)} = e^{-0.3577} $$

--

$$ \frac{\text{Hg for assets x+1}}{\text{Hg for assets x}} \approx 0.70 $$

--

For each SD increase in assets, the hair Hg is expected to be lower, on average, by a factor of 0.70.

# Parameter estimation

---

## Linear model with a single predictor

- We're interested in $\beta_0$ (population parameter for the intercept) and $\beta_1$ (population parameter for the slope) in the following model:

$$y_{i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1~x_{i}+\varepsilon_i$$
where $\varepsilon$ represents random error around our mean

--
- Tough luck, you can't have them...

--
- So we use sample statistics to estimate them, using the notation  $b$ or $\widehat{\beta}$ to distinguish our estimates from the true parameters $\beta$

$$\widehat{y}_{i} = b_0 + b_1~x_{i}$$ or $$\widehat{y}_i = \widehat{\beta}_0 + \widehat{\beta}_1~x_i$$

---

## Least squares regression

- The regression line minimizes the sum of squared residuals.

--
- If $e_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i$, then, the regression line minimizes 
$\sum_{i = 1}^n e_i^2$.

---

## Visualizing residuals

```{r vis-res-1, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%"}
hg_assets_fit <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(lhairHg ~ assets_sc, data = mercury)

hg_assets_fit_tidy <- tidy(hg_assets_fit$fit) 
hg_assets_fit_aug  <- augment(hg_assets_fit$fit) %>%
  mutate(res_cat = ifelse(.resid > 0, TRUE, FALSE))

p <- ggplot(data = hg_assets_fit_aug, 
            aes(x = assets_sc, y = lhairHg)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1) + 
  labs(
    title = "Hair mercury by assets",
    subtitle = "Peruvian Amazon",
    x = "Household assets (standardized)",
    y = "Hair mercury (log ppm)"
    ) +
  #coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 250), ylim = c(0, 200)) +
  theme(plot.subtitle = element_text(colour = "#E48957", face = "bold", size = rel(1.5)))
p
```

---

## Visualizing residuals (cont.)

```{r vis-res-2, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%"}
p <- p + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "#8E2C90", se = FALSE) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(y = .fitted), color = "#E48957") +
  labs(subtitle = "Data + least squares line")
p
```

---

## Visualizing residuals (cont.)

```{r vis-res-3, echo = FALSE, out.width="70%"}
p + 
  geom_segment(mapping = aes(xend = assets_sc, yend = .fitted), color = "#E48957", alpha = 0.4) +
  labs(subtitle = "Data + least squares line + residuals")
```

---

## Properties of least squares regression

- The regression line goes through the center of mass point, the coordinates corresponding to average $x$ and average $y$, $(\bar{x}, \bar{y})$:  

$$\bar{y} = b_0 + b_1 \bar{x} ~ \rightarrow ~ b_0 = \bar{y} - b_1 \bar{x}$$

--
- The slope has the same sign as the correlation coefficient: $b_1 = r \frac{s_y}{s_x}$

--
- The sum of the residuals is zero: $\sum_{i = 1}^n e_i = 0$

--
- The residuals and $x$ values are uncorrelated

---

## Aside: Correlation Coefficient

The *correlation coefficient* describes the linear relationship between $x$ and $y$ on the standard deviation scale.

```{r corr}
cor(mercury$lhairHg,mercury$assets_sc,use="complete.obs")
```

Here, for each one SD increase in assets, we expect a `r round(cor(mercury$lhairHg,mercury$assets_sc,use="complete.obs"),2)` SD increase (so thus a `r -round(cor(mercury$lhairHg,mercury$assets_sc,use="complete.obs"),2)` decrease) in standard deviations of log hair mercury.

```{r echo=FALSE}
mercury %>% 
  filter(lhairHg != "NA") %>%
  select(lhairHg, assets_sc, native_cat) %>%

## Mercury & native community relationship

```{r hg-native-fit}
linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(lhairHg ~ native_cat, data = mercury) %>%
  tidy()
```

---

## Mercury and native communities

Define $\text{Non-native}_i$=1 if non-native community and 0 otherwise.

$$\widehat{y_i} = 1.12 - 1.11~\text{Non-native}_i$$

- **Slope:** Residents of non-native communities, on average, are expected to have Hg concentrations that are -1.11 log ppm lower, on average, than residents of native communities.  Alternatively, the hair Hg is expected to be lower, on average, by a factor of $e^{-1.11}=0.33$ among residents of non-native communities.
  - Compares baseline level (`Native`) to the other level (`Non-native`)
    
- **Intercept:** Individuals living in native communities (`Non-native`=0) are expected to have hair mercury exposures of 1.12 log ppm.

---

## Relationship between mercury and individual community

```{r hg-comm}
linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(lhairHg ~ community, data = mercury) %>%
  tidy()
```

---

## Dummy or indicator variables

```{r ref.label="hg-comm", echo = FALSE}
```

- When the categorical explanatory variable has many levels, they're encoded to **dummy** or **indicator variables**
- Each coefficient describes the expected difference between log mercury concentrations in that particular community compared to the baseline community

- **Boca Colorado** hair mercury levels are expected, on average, to be **0.614 log ppm**.

- etc. It can be nice to have a table showing the estimated mean (along with uncertainty measures -- coming soon) for each community, and a plot can also be useful.
